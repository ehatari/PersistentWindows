* Run PW with customized icon
  * Rename your customized icon file as pwIcon.ico and copy it to 'C:/Users/\<YOUR_ID>/AppData/Local/PersistentWindows/', or copy it to current directory if running (second inst of) PW with -redirect_appdata switch from command console.
  * Add second icon file, rename it to pwIconBusy.ico, this icon is displayed when PW is busy restoring windows.

* Manipulate window z-order
  * Bring a window to top z-order by clear the topmost flag of obstructive window
    * Click on other window first to defocus, then Ctrl click the window (or the corresponding icon on taskbar) that you want to bring to top.
  * Send remote desktop or vncviewer window to bottom z-order (because Alt+Esc hotkey does not work for them)
    * Defocus rdp window first, then hold Ctrl+Win keys and click the rdp window

* Enable/Disable auto restore for any (child or dialog) window
  * To add such window for auto capture/restore, move the window using mouse
  * To remove such window from auto capture/restore, hold Ctrl+Shift keys then move the window
